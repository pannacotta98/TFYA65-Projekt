# Pitchy Per

A simple web game developed as part of the course *TFYA65 â€” Physics of Sound*. The player is driving a scooter, which is controlled by the pitch of their voice, and should avoid other cars. The game was developed in JavaScript using the Phaser framework, and the (somewhat unstable) pitch detection is based on the harmonic product spectrum.

The game is available at https://pannacotta98.github.io/TFYA65-Projekt/.
